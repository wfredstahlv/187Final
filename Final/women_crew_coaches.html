    <h2>Head Coach: Colin Truex</h2>
    <br>
    <p>After five successful seasons as an assistant coach with the UC San Diego men's crew, Colin Truex was named the head coach of the women's program on Aug. 7, 2012.</p>
<p>Truex, who helped guide the Triton men to two Intercollegiate Rowing Association (IRA) Championship Regatta appearances in the previous four years, became the third head coach in program history.</p>

<p>"We are very pleased that Colin will be taking the next step in his coaching career here at UC San Diego," said UCSD Director of Athletics Earl Edwards at the time of Truex's hiring. "His experience coaching both men and women at several respected institutions and his passion for the sport really made him the ideal candidate for the position. He has been a big part of the success of the men's program over the past five years and we are confident that he will be just as successful in leading the women."</p>

<p>Truex came to La Jolla as the first assistant coach prior to the 2007-08 season and helped build UCSD men's crew into one of the top programs on the West Coast. As coach of the novice squad, he led the Tritons to several impressive showings across the country, including a 12th-place finish by the freshman eight boat at the IRA Championship Regatta in 2011.</p>

<p>Truex led UCSD to an especially impressive campaign in 2008-09 as the Tritons put together an undefeated run at the Pac-10 Challenge and then claimed an improbable petite final victory at the San Diego Crew Classic. UCSD's novice squad earned an invitation to the IRAs and went on to finish 17th overall.</p>

    <h2>Assistant Coach: Kimberly Dale</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Kimberly Dale was named an assistant coach with the UC San Diego women's crew program in September of 2012.</p>
<p>Dale arrived at UCSD after spending three years as the men's and women's head rowing coach at Sonoma State. During her three-year tenure at the helm of the Seawolves' program, Dale was also head coach of the North Bay Rowing Club Juniors.</p>

<p>While at SSU, Dale led multiple teams to awards, including a gold medal, silver medal and a sixth-place finish at the 2010 American Collegiate Rowing Association (ACRA) Club Championship for the Varsity Men's Four, Men's Varsity Lightweight Four and the Women's Four, respectively. More recently under Dale's leadership, her Men's Novice Eight team took third at the 2011 Head of the American while her Women's Novice Eight team finished second at the 2012 San Diego Crew Classic.</p>

<p>Dale's affiliation with rowing began as a student-athlete when she was a member of the Orange Coast College team (2003-05). In her two years with the Pirates, Dale's Women's Novice Eight team won a bronze medal at the Western Intercollegiate Rowing Association (WIRA) Championship Regatta in 2005.</p>
