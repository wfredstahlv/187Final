    <h2>Head Coach: Nate Garcia</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Nathan Garcia enters his seventh season as head coach of the UC San Diego men’s and women’s cross country program in 2013. In six years at the helm, Garcia has guided the Tritons to a pair of NCAA National Championship appearances, while also coaching several All-CCAA and All-West Region selections.</p>

<p>In 2012, Garcia guided both the men and women to national rankings, peaking at No. 28 and No. 30, respectively. At the NCAA Division II West Regional Championships in Kahuku, Hawaii, the Triton men took 10th while the women finished 12th overall. After the season concluded, both squads were named to the 2012 U.S. Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association (USTFCCCA) Division II All-Academic Teams, and juniors Kellen Levy and Chia Chang each earned individual USTFCCCA All-Academic Team honors for the second year in a row. Levy additionally was selected to the 2013 Capital One Academic All-District® Men’s Track/Cross Country First Team for the NCAA Division II District 8, as selected by the College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA). </p>

<p>Garcia took over head coaching duties for both programs in 2007 after the resignation of longtime coach and mentor Ted Van Arsdale. He served as an assistant under Van Arsdale for five seasons prior to his appointment to the top spot. In addition to leading the cross country teams, Garcia also coaches distance events for the UCSD track and field teams. </p>

<p>In his first season as head coach, Garcia guided both the men and women’s teams to the 2007 NCAA Division II National Championships, marking just the second time UCSD has accomplished that feat at the D-II level. The women’s team finished 11th at the championships, moving up five places from their 16th place finish in 2006, while the men finished in the 20th spot, which was their highest finish since 2003.</p>

She coached and mentored athletes that qualified for the USATF Junior Olympic National Championships, including one that won national titles in the 800- and 1500-meter events in 2010. </p>

<p>During the 2007-08 academic year, Hitchings was the head women's cross country coach and assistant track and field coach at Cal State Bakersfield</p>
