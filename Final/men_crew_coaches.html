    <h2>Head Coach: Zach Johnson</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Zach Johnson enters his eighth season as head coach of UCSD's men's rowing program in 2013-14. He has been with the Tritons since 2004-05 when he was named an assistant coach.</p>
<p>During his tenure, Johnson has taken the program to new heights and expectations. In each of his seasons, the team has achieved new goals and set new standards. Never ranked prior to the 2007 season, UCSD has now spent time ranked in the top 25 of the U.S. Rowing Collegiate Poll in five of the last seven seasons.</p>

<p>Team highlights under Johnson include wins at the 2007 and 2009 San Diego Crew Classic Cal Cup events, as well as invitations to the Crew Classic Copley Cup in 2008, 2010, 2011 and 2012 as one of the country's top crews. In 2011, UCSD became the first non-Pac-12 program to qualify for the Copley Cup Grand Final, taking fifth place overall and defeating traditional powerhouses along the way.</p>

<p>In addition, the team has enjoyed success at races such as the Stanford Invitational, where UCSD has compiled a winning record in duel races; the George Washington Invitational, where the team placed second overall in team points in 2012; the SIRA Regatta, where the Tritons finished second overall in 2011; and the WIRA Championship Regatta, where UCSD has never finished lower than third and won the overall team championship in 2006 and 2011.</p>

    <h2>Assistant Coach: Jeff Collett</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Former Triton rower Jeff Collett was named an assistant coach with the program in August of 2013.</p>

<p>Most recently, Collett worked with the Newport Aquatic Center in Newport Beach, serving as the program's head coach from 2010-13. Newport, with over 150 rowers, consistently placed in the top five in the Southwest Region. In addition to managing the racing and training schedules, Collett also oversaw the annual budget and fundraising efforts.</p>

<p>From 2009-10, Collett was an assistant coach with Newport, which won a California state title and the Southwest Region Team Points Trophy during that period. The Lightweight 8+ and Heavyweight 4+ crews both placed third at the U.S. Rowing Junior National Championships.</p>
