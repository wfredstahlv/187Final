    <h2>Head Coach: Eric Newman</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Eric Newman is in his third season as the head coach of the UC San Diego baseball program in 2014. He was named to the position on Aug. 29, 2011, becoming the team's second leader since the school moved to NCAA Division II status for the 2001 season.</p>

<p>In 2012, his first campaign with the Tritons, Newman was named the California Collegiate Athletic Association (CCAA) Coach of the Year after guiding the team to its fourth straight league regular-season and tournament championships. The Tritons qualified for their sixth consecutive NCAA West Regional as well.</p>

<p>UCSD won a slew of individual awards, led by starting pitcher Ryan Goodbrand and centerfielder Danny Susdorf, who each garnered All-America recognition. Six Tritons picked up all-region accolades and eight were named to All-CCAA teams. Reliever Elias Tuma showed his prowess in the classroom as well by being named a Capital One Academic All-American.</p>

<p>The 2013 season was a 10th straight in which UCSD produced a winning overall record. Susdorf was a consensus all-region performer, Troy Cruz joined him on the All-CCAA First Team as the CCAA Freshman of the Year, and shortstop Dillon Moyer was made the 38th-round draft selection of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Four Tritons in all have been offered professional contracts since Newman arrived on campus, in Moyer, Tuma, Jeff Rauh and Tony York.</p>

    <h2>Assistant Coach: Rob Avila</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Rob Avila is in his third season as an assistant coach with the UC San Diego baseball program in 2014 after being named to the post in September of 2011.</p>
<p>Avila serves as UCSD's pitching coach while assisting with recruiting and coordinating camps.</p>

<p>In his first year in La Jolla, Avila guided a staff that ranked third in the California Collegiate Athletic Association (CCAA) and 57th nationally in the NCAA Division II with a 3.88 ERA. The Tritons won their fourth successive CCAA regular-season and tournament titles. Junior ace Ryan Goodbrand posted an unblemished 11-0 record to earn All-America honorable mention, while three senior pitchers, Jeff Rauh, Elias Tuma and Tony York, were offered professional contracts at the end of the season.</p>

<p>The 2013 season was a 10th straight in which UCSD produced a winning overall record, with Avila's staff posting the third-best strikeout-to-walk ratio (2.18) in the CCAA.</p>

<p>Prior to joining the Tritons, Avila was the head coach at Palm Beach Atlantic University in West Palm Beach, Fla., from 2005-10, where he led the Sailfish to two National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA) South Region championships in four seasons. He was named the NCCAA South Region Coach of the Year in 2006 and 2009. In both of those years, the Sailfish finished ninth in the NCCAA. During his tenure, Avila coached one All-American and 22 all-region selections. Three players went on to sign professional contracts.</p>

    <h2>Assistant Coach: J.T. Bloodworth</h2>
    <br>
    <p>J.T. Bloodworth is in his second season as an assistant coach for the UC San Diego baseball program in 2014. He was named to the position in September of 2012.</p>

<p>Bloodworth's responsibilities include working with the Triton defense and infielders, while also assisting with recruiting.</p>

<p>In 2013, UCSD was ranked in the top 10 nationally in the NCAA Division II with a .972 fielding percentage (1271-500-51).</p>

<p>Leading up to his arrival in La Jolla, Bloodworth was the top assistant coach and recruiting coordinator at Lon Morris College in Jacksonville, Texas, for the 2012 season. In that same year, he also served as an instructor at IMG Academy in Bradenton, Fla., developing high school players from around the country.</p>

<p>From 2008 through 2011, Bloodworth was at New Mexico State University, where he assisted with recruiting and served as the defensive coach alongside Hall of Famer Gary Ward. In his first season in Las Cruces, N.M., in 2009, Bloodworth had an immediate impact on the Aggie defense, which broke two school records with 701 assists and 69 double plays (ranked seventh nationally). NMSU also matched the program standard for fielding percentage at .968, committing only 76 errors, a dramatic improvement over a .942 clip and 138 errors the season before. The Aggies won 44 games in 2009, another school record.</p>
